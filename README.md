# Dwinn's Example Home Assistant Configuration Files 

Here is a set of configuration files that represents my current [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) instance. If you have seen the video demonstration on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw4JFLhTVN8), I will explain how I achieved the current look of the UI, including the Lovelace cards, custom components, Hass.io addons I used. TBD!

NOTE: To use this properly, you will need to enable the Lovelace YAML mode in your configuration.yaml and create the ui-lovelace.yaml file. See instructions on the [Home Assistant site](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/yaml-mode/). It is a lot more work (and pain), but you can customize to your liking.
