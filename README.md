# Dwinn's Example Home Assistant Configuration Files 

Here is a set of configuration files that represents my current [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) instance. If you have seen the video demonstration on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dw4JFLhTVN8), I will explain how I achieved the current look of the UI, including the Lovelace cards, custom components, Hass.io addons I used. TBD!

- People ([ccostan](https://github.com/CCOSTAN/Home-AssistantConfig), [skavala](https://github.com/skalavala/smarthome)) who shared their Home Assistant configurations, which I borrowed heavily from.
